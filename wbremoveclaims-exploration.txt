I did an investigation into the regularity of edit comments containing "wbremoveclaims" on 2019-12-10.
This file documents the most important queries run and the findings from examining the results
of those queries. All of these queries were run against the replicated MediaWiki database
for Wikimedia Commons.

I first ran this query to get the format of wbremoveclaims:

SELECT comment_text
FROM comment
JOIN revision_comment_temp
ON comment_id=revcomment_comment_id
JOIN revision
ON revcomment_rev = rev_id
WHERE rev_timestamp >= '20190801000000'
AND rev_timestamp < '20190901000000'
AND comment_text REGEXP "wbremoveclaims"
LIMIT 250;

I inspected the rows returned and noticed that all edit comments that used "wbremoveclaims-remove" would also
contain a reference to d:Special:EntityPage (as a link to WikiData). In the analysis we're running, we use
data from Aug 1 to Dec 1, 2019, so I ran the following query to confirm that every edit comment that contains
"wbremoveclaims-remove" also contains "d:Special:EntityPage":

SELECT comment_text
FROM comment
JOIN revision_comment_temp
ON comment_id=revcomment_comment_id
JOIN revision
ON revcomment_rev = rev_id
WHERE rev_timestamp >= '20190801000000'
AND rev_timestamp < '20191201000000'
AND comment_text REGEXP "wbremoveclaims-remove"
AND comment_text NOT REGEXP "EntityPage"
LIMIT 250;

This query took a few minutes to run, and returned 0 rows. Based on this, my conclusion was that this
type of edit comment means a single statement was removed.

Next, I wanted to look at what happens if the edit comment contains "wbremoveclaims-update", and
I ran the following query:

SELECT page_namespace, page_title, rev_timestamp, rev_id, comment_text
FROM comment
JOIN revision_comment_temp
ON comment_id=revcomment_comment_id
JOIN revision ON revcomment_rev = rev_id
JOIN page
ON rev_page=page_id
WHERE rev_timestamp >= '20191101000000'
AND rev_timestamp < '20191201000000'
AND comment_text REGEXP "wbremoveclaims-update"
LIMIT 250;

Inspecting the edit comments, I noticed that some of them mention a single property (statement) being removed,
while some of them do not mention anything. I randomly chose a few of the ones that do not mention any property
and grabbed the diff of those edits. There, I noticed that they always appeared to be removing multiple
statements. In other words, if a property is mentioned it means a single statement was removed.

Lastly, I ran this query to count how many edits removed multiple statements, so I could get a sense
of how big of an impact that might have:

SELECT count(*)
FROM comment
JOIN revision_comment_temp
ON comment_id=revcomment_comment_id
JOIN revision
ON revcomment_rev = rev_id
WHERE rev_timestamp >= '20190801000000'
AND rev_timestamp < '20191201000000'
AND comment_text REGEXP "wbremoveclaims-update"
AND comment_text NOT REGEXP "MediaInfo.*removed";

This query returned a count of 194, indicating that relative to the >1.5M edits that appear to add one
(or more) statements, the removal of multiple statements will not have a significant impact on our
estimates.
